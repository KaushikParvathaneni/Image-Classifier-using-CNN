# Image-Classifier-using-CNN

In my project, I implemented various machine learning techniques to address object detection in grayscale, downsized images. I analyzed the dataset of 500,000 training images across 100 categories and used sampling to manage its size. I experimented with different models, including KNN, SVM, and neural networks, ultimately refining a convolutional neural network (CNN) for the best performance. My preprocessing involved normalization and data augmentation to enhance model robustness. The final model significantly improved over the baseline accuracy. I
